      <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where we have your consent to do so.</li>
        <li>Where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g., to provide services you have requested).</li>
        <li>Where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., for our marketing purposes, to prevent fraud, or to secure our systems).</li>
        <li>Where we have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
      <p>We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing (if applicable), data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. These service providers will have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws (such as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 in the Philippines), you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The right to be informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to erasure (or to be forgotten):</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to object to processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to withdraw consent:</strong> If we are processing your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You have the right to file a complaint with a relevant data protection authority (e.g., the National Privacy Commission in the Philippines) if you believe that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.</li>

When you access the Website, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default.
      </p>
      <p>You can choose to set your browser to remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Website. You may not be able to decline web beacons.

      <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the Philippines and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to the Philippines and process it there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.
